Built with Django, Bootstrap (local), and SQLite (default).

---

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project locally.

---

### 1. Clone the Repository

### 2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

Itâ€™s best practice to isolate project dependencies.

**For Windows (PowerShell):**

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

**For macOS/Linux:**

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install all required packages from `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### 4. Apply Database Migrations

Run the following to set up your SQLite database:

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

---

### 5. Create a Superuser (Admin)

To log in to the Django admin dashboard:

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Follow the prompts to set username, email, and password.

---

### 6. Run the Development Server

Start the server:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

By default, the app will be available at:
ðŸ‘‰ [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/)

Would you like me to also **generate the `requirements.txt`** (with pinned Django + supporting packages), so anyone following this README can just install everything without errors?
